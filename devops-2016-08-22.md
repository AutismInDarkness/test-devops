# DevOps test from Wiredcraft

## Thchnical stack

Here is the list of the technologies that we can use in the test:

* Ansible
* Jekyll or Hugo
* Git
* Programming Language: Python / Shell or any other language.
* `fortune` which is a shell command generating quote / adage from famous people.


## Task

Our test is comprised of two aspects: development and operations.

### Sub-task 1

For the development part, you need to build a website based on Jekyll or Hugo, upon which, a new page should be generated each time after running a script you are going to write. New page should also needs to be added to git repo, committed, tagged with version number and pushed to github with this script.

In detail, you should do the following things:

* Choose whichever static site generator to use and prepare the basic site:
  * [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
  * [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

* Prepare the template, the page itself is based on a template which you are going to write on your will with your own design, requiring:
  * Simple yaml header with version number and text.
  * Simple content template to put the text and version number in the footer.
  * Style is optional.

* Create a script that will:
  * Create a new post relying on the template previously defined.
  * Update the version incrementally.

* Based on the description above, remember there is a number of items needs to be filled in this template when generating new page with the script:
  * The quote / adage you get from `fortune` command.
  * The version number of this change.

* The script accept one argument passed to it, and then behave accordingly, the choices are:
  * dev - increase the version by 0.0.1, genereate a new page the way described above, and then push it to github.
  * staging - increase the version by 0.1 (eg: from `0.1.5` to `0.2.0`), tag it and then push it to github.

### Sub-task 2

For the operation part, you need to write ansible playbook to create an environment serving two versions (dev and staging) of this project as two websites, which can update itself by synchronizing the codebase from github say every n minutes if there is actual change in github repo.

The playbook should be able to do the following things:

* Spawn a box with:
  * ubuntu 16.04
  * Nginx with configuration supporting two domains: dev & staging
  * Ruby / Jekyll or Go, this depend on the choice of your dev project above.

* Configure the box to:
  * Compile and build the code (jekyll or hugo)
  * Deploy the dev / staging environments accordingly.

* Prepare automated task to run the created script mentioned in development part.
  * Update dev environemnt every 10 minutes.
  * Update staging environment every 1 hour.

* Prepare automated task to auto update the served sites every 5 minutes following roles:
  * if there is new commit, then update the dev server
  * if there is new tag, then update the staging server
